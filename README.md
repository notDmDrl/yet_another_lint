# Yet Another Lint

[![Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/badge.svg)](https://common-changelog.org)

_Yet another_ lint rules package with a set of Dart and Flutter linter rules and analyzer setup.
It's incredibly strict, with only around 10 to 15 rules disabled out of +-230, depending on the chosen set.

`yet_another_lint` provides 2 different sets of rules:

-   `defaults` - strict production-ready rule set. Uses 120 chars page width.
-   `package` - based on the `defaults` rule set with 4 additional rules, that make sense for package development, enabled. Uses 80 chars page width.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The package's minimum Dart version is set to the version used by the latest Flutter Beta version.
>
> For version **1.0.7+1** minimum Dart version is **3.9.0-100.2.beta**

## Enabling the lints
